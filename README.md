A Somali language AI assistant for learning, translation, and daily support.


 Somali AI Assistant

An AI-powered assistant built specifically to understand and communicate in the Somali language. The goal is to provide Somali-speaking users with intelligent support for education, daily communication, translation, and local access to AI tools.


 🌟 Inspiration

Most AI tools are developed for widely spoken languages, leaving out millions of Somali speakers. I wanted to create something that directly supports my community, in our own language.


💡 What it does

Somali AI Assistant helps with:

• Somali language understanding and generation
• Answering educational questions in Somali
• Translating between Somali and English
• Providing general knowledge help and daily support



 🛠️ How I built it

 Languages/Frameworks: Python, HTML, JavaScript
• Platform**: Gradio for the UI
• AI Model**: Based on Hugging Face Transformers (custom Somali fine-tuned model)
• Deployment**: HuggingFace Spaces
• Tools**: Google Colab, GitHub



 🧗 Challenges I ran into

• Lack of Somali language datasets
• Limited open-source NLP resources for Somali
• Fine-tuning small models with limited compute
• Building a clean, functional UI with no frontend experience


 🏆 Accomplishments that I'm proud of

• Created a Somali-first assistant using modern AI tools
• Deployed a live demo that anyone can test
• Learned how to train and deploy models in a short time
• Participated in my first international hackathon


 📚 What I learned

• How to train and deploy NLP models
• Using Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces • Markdown formatting, GitHub repo structure
• Improving project storytelling and pitching


 🔮 What's next for Somali Smart Assistant

Add voice support (text-to-speech & speech-to-text in Somali)
 Extend to a mobile app for offline usage
 Add support for more local dialects and languages
 Open-source the dataset and improve documentation
